Please answer the following questions:

- How many VPCs do I have in this region?
- Do any have access to the internet via an IGW?
- Are there any NAT gateways?
- And what are the routes available for each VPC? 
- For the VPC change and remove the ID to VPC-1, VPC-2, etc.
- Rename and remove the route table IDs sequentially as RT-1, RT-2, IGW-1, IGW-2, NATGW-1, NATGW-2, etc. ensuring the numbering aligns with the VPC they belong to. 
- Return as a well structured table.

Here is a example:

<example> 
VPC ID | Internet Access | Route Table ID | Routes 
-------|-----------------|-----------------|-------- 
VPC-1 | Yes | RT-1 | x.x.x.x/16 -> destination, x.x.x.x/16 -> None, x.x.x.x/16 -> local 
</example>

Please ensure all items are properly entered into the table. 

Take your time and think step by step.
